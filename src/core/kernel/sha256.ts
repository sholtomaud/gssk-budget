/* SHA-256, FIPS 180-4, with no dependencies.
 *
 * Why this exists: the kernel binary is verified against its pinned digest
 * before it is compiled (REQ-KERN-1), and that check must work everywhere the
 * app runs. `crypto.subtle` does not — Web Crypto is exposed only in a secure
 * context, so a dev server reached at a LAN address has no `crypto.subtle` and
 * the verification would be impossible exactly where a household is most
 * likely to be testing on a second device.
 *
 * Making verification optional was the wrong answer; making it independent of
 * the platform is the right one. digest.ts prefers crypto.subtle when it is
 * there — it is faster and battle-tested — and falls back to this. A test
 * asserts the two agree, including on the real kernel binary, so the fallback
 * cannot drift into producing a different answer.
 *
 * This is an integrity check, not a secret: it catches a swapped, truncated or
 * stale binary. It is not used for authentication and holds no key.
